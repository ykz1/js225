// Exercise 1
// The animals, as described, share polymorphic interfaces. Animals share similar interfaces i.e. behaviours / methods, though each implements these methods in different ways.

// Exercise 2
// Encapsulation is the relationship here. The ways that each instance of an automobile are different all relate to state, and they all share the same behaviours / methods. The states / data for each instance can be defined instance-by-instance, but the variables that hold this data is defined at the Automobile level.
// Why is not just inheritance? Is encapsulation what each type offers to instance of that type, and inheritance what each type offers to another general type which is more specific but also not specific enough to be an instance themself?

// Exercise 3
// State: make, model, year
// Behaviours: start, drive, park


// Exercise 4
// Inheritance. Plant and Animal both inherit from some parent type / class...maybe LivingThings. Then Tree and Flower would inherit from Plant, and Mammal and Bird would inherit from Animal.
